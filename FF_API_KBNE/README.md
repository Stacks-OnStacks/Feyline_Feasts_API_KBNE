## The Goal
<br />

The goal of Our App is to develop a functional API for a theoretical small restaurant in order to improve the restaurantâ€™s productivity. <br />
The app is planned to have the ability for customers to place orders through the app.<br />
An admin side will exist so the owners can add, update and remove items from the menu. <br />
This app will leverage RESTful design using an embedded tomcat server to handle incoming requests<br />
to thoroughly tested services that must be persisted using Hibernate and AWS PostgreSQL services. <br />
